# AQPerf

Performs basic parse and split calculations based on the following:

- Total parse is calculated using standard "summary" pases, excluding Viscidus
- Not using GNPP on both Viscidus and Princes Huhuran results in a 100 gold fine
- Not using frost weapons and wands on Visc as well as frost oils for mele results in 100g fine
- 10% split reduction will be issued per world buff for players with less than two buffs.
